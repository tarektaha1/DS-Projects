# GPA Trends Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes GPA trends at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) using Python and data visualization techniques. The goal is to explore potential grade inflation, compare GPA trends across departments, and assess course difficulty through weighted GPA calculations.

## Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Cleaned and structured UIUC grading data using Pandas.
  - Conducted statistical analysis on GPA distributions.
  
- **Weighted GPA Calculation:**
  - Designed a model to adjust GPA based on course difficulty.
  - Compared trends across different academic departments.
  
- **Data Visualization:**
  - Created interactive line charts and histograms using Matplotlib.
  - Highlighted long-term GPA patterns and anomalies.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Git, GitHub

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GPA-Trends-Analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```sh
   cd GPA-Trends-Analysis
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage
- Open the Jupyter Notebook (`Analyzing_GPA_Trends.ipynb`) and run the cells sequentially.
- Modify parameters (e.g., year range, department filters) for custom analysis.

## Results
- Key insights on GPA inflation trends over the years.
- Comparison of average GPAs across different academic programs.

## Future Enhancements
- Extend analysis to additional universities.
- Implement machine learning models to predict GPA trends.
